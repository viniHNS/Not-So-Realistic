## What is this?

This is a mod for [SPT](https://www.sp-tarkov.com "The main goal of the project is to provide a single-player offline experience with ready-to-use progression for the official BSG client. Now you can play Escape From Tarkov while waiting for their servers to come back online, when you're offline, or if you need a break from cheaters.") that improves a little the gameplay of the game, enhancing the existing meds and mechanics.

#### Some QOL changes.

## New Medications

- Paracetamol  
###### Lowers the PMC's temperature for a short time and also relieves pain for a short period with a small delay.

- Exodrine
###### The Exodrine is designed to push human endurance to their absolute limits, providing extraordinary boosts in physical strength, making it invaluable in high-stakes combat scenarios. However, its potent effects come at a <span style="color: red">severe cost</span>, with unpredictable side effects that can leave the user debilitated after the stimulant wears off.
